# Linear-Regression-
This project implements and explains Simple Linear Regression and Multiple Linear Regression using Pythonâ€™s scikit-learn library, with the California Housing dataset as the case study. It is part of my internship tasks, aimed at building practical understanding of regression analysis, evaluation metrics, and interpretation of model outputs.
