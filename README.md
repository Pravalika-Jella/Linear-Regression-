# Linear Regression â€“ Simple & Multiple (California Housing Dataset)

This project demonstrates the implementation and understanding of **Simple Linear Regression** and **Multiple Linear Regression** using Python's **scikit-learn** library. The **California Housing dataset** is used as a case study to explore regression concepts, evaluation metrics, and model interpretation. This work is part of my internship tasks.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
Linear regression is one of the most fundamental algorithms in machine learning, used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features).

- **Simple Linear Regression:** Uses a single feature to predict the target value and fits a straight line (`y = m*x + c`).
- **Multiple Linear Regression:** Uses multiple features to predict the target, fitting a multidimensional plane.

## ðŸ›  Steps Performed
1. **Import & Preprocess Data** â€“ Loaded the California Housing dataset, checked structure, and selected features.
2. **Train-Test Split** â€“ Divided the dataset into training and testing sets.
3. **Model Training** â€“ Trained both simple and multiple linear regression models using `LinearRegression` from scikit-learn.
4. **Evaluation** â€“ Assessed models with:
   - Mean Absolute Error (**MAE**)
   - Mean Squared Error (**MSE**)
   - Coefficient of Determination (**RÂ² Score**)
5. **Visualization** â€“ 
   - Plotted regression line for simple regression.
   - Compared predicted vs. actual values for multiple regression.
6. **Multicollinearity Check** â€“ Calculated **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)** for all predictors.

## ðŸ“Š Evaluation Metrics
- **MAE:** Measures the average magnitude of errors without considering direction.
- **MSE:** Penalizes larger errors more than MAE.
- **RÂ² Score:** Shows how well the features explain the target variable's variance.
